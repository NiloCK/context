MOTIVATION:
The Ethereum state is growing, and VKTs offer a good mitigation strategy to stem this growth and enable weak statelessness. Owing to the difficulty

RATIONALE:
This approach doesn't convert the state, which is left to a subsequent EIP. This is meant as a stopgap in case we decide to

SUMMARY:
This EIP proposes a neutral effective balance (EB) design to ensure `0x01` (skimming) and `0x02` (compounding) validators receive equal yields. Currently, validators that compound

SPECIFICATION:
### Parameters Change two existing constants: | Constant | Value | - | - | | `HYSTERESIS_DOWNWARD_MULTIPLIER` | `3` | | `HYSTERESIS_UPWARD_MULTIPLIER` | `2`

MOTIVATION:
The roadmap for fast finality hinges on stake consolidation, where staking service providers (SSPs) transition from running 32-ETH validators with `0x01` credentials to compounding

SPECIFICATION:
### `eth_getBlockByNumber` #### Description Returns information about a block specified by number. Every block returned by this endpoint whose block number is before the

MOTIVATION:
[EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) introduces a base fee per gas in protocol. This value is maintained under consensus as a new field in the block header structure.

RATIONALE:
The addition of a single parameter instead of introducing a whole new endpoint was the simplest change that would be easiest to get integrated.

SUMMARY:
This proposal introduces a mechanism to make execution blocks statically verifiable through minimal checks that only require the previous state, without requiring execution of

SPECIFICATION:
### Header Changes The block header structure is extended to support delayed execution: ```python @dataclass class Header: # Existing fields parent_hash: Hash32 ommers_hash: Hash32

MOTIVATION:
The primary advantage of this proposal is **asynchronous block validation**. In the current Ethereum protocol, blocks must be fully executed before validators can attest

RATIONALE:
### Deferred Execution Outputs The core innovation of deferring execution outputs to the next block enables static and stateful validation without requiring immediate execution.

SPECIFICATION:
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted

MOTIVATION:
The `SELFDESTRUCT` instruction has a fixed price, but is unbounded in storage/account changes (it needs to delete all keys). This has been an outstanding

This EIP replaces the intermediate state root field of the receipt with a status code indicating if the top-level call succeeded or failed.

SPECIFICATION:
For blocks where block.number >= BYZANTIUM_FORK_BLKNUM, the intermediate state root is replaced by a status code, 0 indicating failure (due to any operation that

MOTIVATION:
With the introduction of the REVERT opcode in EIP140, it is no longer possible for users to assume that a transaction failed iff it

SUMMARY:
Add a new opcode, `IMPERSONATECALL` at `0xf6`, which is similar in idea to `CALL (0xF1)`, except that it impersonates a sender, i.e. the callee

SPECIFICATION:
`IMPERSONATECALL`: `0xf6`, takes 7 operands: - `gas`: the amount of gas the code may use in order to execute; - `to`: the destination address

MOTIVATION:
This proposal enables native multi-user wallets (wallets that serve multiple users) that can be commanded by EIP-712 based messages and therefore enable meta-transactions. Multi-user

RATIONALE:
Even if `IMPERSONATECALL` requires hashing 3 words, implying an additional cost of 180 gas, we think the benefit of accounting for hashing doesn't not

SUMMARY:
This EIP proposes accounting for time between blocks in the base fee calculation to target a stable throughput by time, instead of by block.

SPECIFICATION:
Using the pseudocode language of [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md), the updated base fee calculation becomes: ```python ... BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR = 8 BLOCK_TIME_TARGET = 12 MAX_GAS_TARGET_PERCENT = 95 class

MOTIVATION:
The current base fee calculation chooses the gas usage of a block as the signal to determine whether demand for block space is too

### `MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS` Increase The main specification change introduced by this EIP is setting MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS to 2**25: ```diff + MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS = 2**25 - MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS =

MOTIVATION:
When scoping 4844, the thinking was that blobs would only enter price discovery once, relatively quickly after the blob rollout; however, this has not

RATIONALE:
The current MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS is 1 wei. This is many orders of magnitude lower than the prevailing price of blobs when blobs enter price discovery.

REQUIRES: 2, 1, 4, ,,  , 1, 3, 5, 2

SUMMARY:
Reduce the base gas cost of calling precompiles using `STATICCALL` from 700 to 40. This should allow more efficient use of precompiles as well

SPECIFICATION:
After block `HF` the `STATICCALL` (`0xfa`) instruction charges different basic gas cost (G<sub>call</sub> in [Yellow Paper]'s notation) depending on the destination address provided: -

MOTIVATION:
The Spurious Dragon hard fork increased the cost of calls significantly to account for loading contract code from the state without making an exception

RATIONALE:
Only the `STATICCALL` instruction was changed to reduce the impact of the change. This should not be a limiting factor, given precompiles (currently) do

Change `SELFDESTRUCT` to not delete all storage keys, and to use a special value in the account nonce to signal *deactivated* accounts. Because the

SPECIFICATION:
1. Change the rules introduced by [EIP-2681](./eip-2681.md) such that regular nonce increase is bound by `2^64-2` instead of `2^64-1`. This applies from genesis. 2.

MOTIVATION:
The `SELFDESTRUCT` instruction currently has a fixed price, but is unbounded in terms of how many storage/account changes it performs (it needs to delete

RATIONALE:
There have been various proposals of removing `SELFDESTRUCT` and many would just outright remove the deletion capability. This breaks certain usage patterns, which the

If `block_number >= X` set the gas cost of the following precompiles and Keccak256 opcode: - SHA256 (precompile `0x02`): `10 + ((len(input) + 8)/64

MOTIVATION:
Historical pricing for these functions in EVM does not reflect inner structure of the underlying computations (inner structure of the hash functions). - EIP-2046

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to

MOTIVATION:
Currently, signing messages relies heavily on ERC-191 version 0x45 (`eth_sign`) and [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) (`eth_signTypedData`). While EIP-712 provides a more structured approach, it is often seen

SPECIFICATION:
* The `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode is renamed to `SENDALL`, and now only immediately moves all ETH in the account to the target; it no longer

MOTIVATION:
The `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode requires large changes to the state of an account, in particular removing all code and storage. This will not be possible

MOTIVATION:
Currently, slashed validators can still be selected as proposers, though their blocks are considered invalid by the state transition function, resulting in missed slots.

SPECIFICATION:
Two new flags are added to the EVM state: overflow (`ovf`) and signed overflow (`sovf`). The `ovf` flag is set in the following circumstances:

MOTIVATION:
The correct functioning of many contracts today is dependent on detecting and preventing overflow of arithmetic operations. Since the EVM operates on mod 2^256

RATIONALE:
Any change to implement overflow protection needs to preserve behaviour of existing contracts, which precludes many changes to the arithmetic operations themselves. One option

MOTIVATION:
Account nonces are currently specified to be arbitrarily long unsigned integers. Dealing with arbitrary length data in the state witnesses is not optimal, therefore

### Status message changes Modify the `Status (0x00)` message as follows: - (eth/68): `[version: P, networkid: P, td: P, blockhash: B_32, genesis: B_32, forkid]`

MOTIVATION:
### Block range in Status message In the history expiry working group, it was decided that clients may drop pre-merge history from their storage

SPECIFICATION:
#### Relax Difficulty with Fake Block Number For the purposes of `calc_difficulty`, simply replace the use of `block.number`, as used in the exponential ice

MOTIVATION:
The difficulty bomb started to become noticeable again on October 5th 2019 at block 8,600,000. Block times have been around 13.1s on average and

RATIONALE:
This will delay the ice age by 52 million seconds (approximately 611 days), so the chain would be back at 20 second block times

The address range between `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000100` and `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000001ff` is reserved for use by the RIP process.

MOTIVATION:
As L2s begin to deploy RIPs, it is necessary to reserve an address range for use by the RIP process so as to ensure

RATIONALE:
By reserving an address range for RIPs, it allows the RIP process to maintain its own registry of precompiles that are not (necessarily) deployed

SPECIFICATION:
At the start of transaction execution, `accessed_addresses` shall be initialized to also include the address returned by `COINBASE` (`0x41`).

MOTIVATION:
Direct `COINBASE` payments are becoming increasingly popular because they allow conditional payments, which provide benefits such as implicit cancellation of transactions that would revert.

TITLE: Delayed State Root
TYPE: Standards Track Core
STATUS: Draft
CREATED: 2024-12-23
REQUIRES: 

SUMMARY:
This proposal introduces a mechanism to decouple state root computation from block validation by deferring the execution layer's state root reference by one block.

SPECIFICATION:
### Header Changes The block header structure is modified to support delayed state root computation: ```python @dataclass class Header: # Existing fields parent_hash: Hash32

MOTIVATION:
The primary advantage of this proposal is **asynchronous state root computation**. In the current Ethereum protocol, blocks must compute and include their own post-state

RATIONALE:
### Latency Reduction The separation of state root computation from block validation removes the primary latency bottleneck in block production and validation. Proposers and

This EIP introduces two EVM instructions `AUTH` and `AUTHCALL`. The first sets a context variable `authorized` based on an ECDSA signature. The second sends

SPECIFICATION:
### Conventions - **`top - N`** - the `N`th most recently pushed value on the EVM stack, where `top - 0` is the most

MOTIVATION:
Adding more functionality to EOAs has been a long-standing feature request. The requests have spanned from implementing batching capabilities, allowing for gas sponsoring, expirations,

RATIONALE:
### Signature in Memory The signature format (`yParity`, `r`, and `s`) is fixed, so it might seem curious that `auth` accepts a dynamic memory

TITLE: Structured Definitions for Net Gas Metering
TYPE: Standards Track Core
STATUS: Final
CREATED: 2019-07-18
REQUIRES: 

SUMMARY:
This EIP provides a structured definition of net gas metering changes for `SSTORE` opcode, enabling new usages for contract storage, and reducing excessive gas

SPECIFICATION:
Define variables `SLOAD_GAS`, `SSTORE_SET_GAS`, `SSTORE_RESET_GAS` and `SSTORE_CLEARS_SCHEDULE`. The old and new values for those variables are: * `SLOAD_GAS`: changed from `200` to `800`. *

MOTIVATION:
This EIP proposes a way for gas metering on `SSTORE`, using information that is more universally available to most implementations, and require as little

RATIONALE:
This EIP mostly achieves what a transient storage tries to do ([EIP-1087] and [EIP-1153]), but without the complexity of introducing the concept of "dirty

SUMMARY:
This proposal introduces a protocol-level cap on the maximum gas usage per transaction to 16,777,216 (2^24) gas. By implementing this limit, Ethereum can enhance

SPECIFICATION:
### Gas Cap - Enforce a protocol-level maximum of **16,777,216 gas (2^24)** for any single transaction. - This cap applies regardless of the block

MOTIVATION:
Currently, transactions can theoretically consume up to the entire block gas limit, which poses several risks: 1. **DoS Attacks**: A single transaction consuming most

RATIONALE:
### Why 16,777,216 (2^24)? The proposed cap of 16,777,216 gas (2^24) provides a clean power-of-two boundary that simplifies implementation while still being large enough

SUMMARY:
Introduces a modification to the consensus layer specification which ensures that slashed validator cannot be elected as block proposer.

SPECIFICATION:
Specification of the proposed change can be found in [`/_features/eip6988/beacon-chain.md`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/0ad3972725e7c22e8edf3bab2dd7730acbe3c272/specs/_features/eip6988/beacon-chain.md).

MOTIVATION:
A block proposed by a slashed validator is rejected by the corresponding validity check in the [`phase0/process_block_header`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/3115d1140b23dd4c9c23fbd9e2428186cf816bde/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#block-header) function as defined in the consensus layer

SUMMARY:
Starting with `CNSTNTNPL_FORK_BLKNUM` the client will calculate the difficulty based on a fake block number suggesting the client that the difficulty bomb is adjusting

SPECIFICATION:
#### Relax Difficulty with Fake Block Number For the purposes of `calc_difficulty`, simply replace the use of `block.number`, as used in the exponential ice

MOTIVATION:
The Casper development and switch to proof-of-stake is delayed, the Ethash proof-of-work should be feasible for miners and allow sealing new blocks every 15

RATIONALE:
This will delay the ice age by 29 million seconds (approximately 12 months), so the chain would be back at 30 second block times

Currently, the beacon block in Ethereum Consensus embeds transactions within the `ExecutionPayload` field of `BeaconBlockBody`. This EIP proposes to replace `ExecutionPayload` with `ExecutionPayloadHeader` in

SPECIFICATION:
- `ExecutionPayload` in the `BeaconBlockBody` is replaced by `ExecutionPayloadHeader` - `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof` is computed by the block proposer/builder and gossiped independently on a separate new

MOTIVATION:
The Ethereum protocol has an ambitious goal to grow the `gasLimit` of the execution payloads (possibly by 10X). This leads to larger messages, negatively

SPECIFICATION:
#### Relax Difficulty with Fake Block Number For the purposes of `calc_difficulty`, simply replace the use of `block.number`, as used in the exponential ice

MOTIVATION:
The Casper development and switch to proof-of-stake is delayed, the Ethash proof-of-work should be feasible for miners and allow sealing new blocks every 15

RATIONALE:
This will delay the ice age by 42 million seconds (approximately 1.4 years), so the chain would be back at 30 second block times

TITLE: Increase calldata cost
TYPE: Standards Track Core
STATUS: Stagnant
CREATED: 2024-05-07
REQUIRES: 

SUMMARY:
An adjustment in the Ethereum calldata cost which reduces the maximum possible block size and allows a higher block gas limit.

SPECIFICATION:
* Increase `G_CALLDATAZERO` from 4 to 12. * Increase `G_CALLDATANONZERO` from 16 to 48.

MOTIVATION:
Larger blocks take longer to propagate through the network. In this way, the maximum potential block size is constraining the block gas limit. Therefore,

RATIONALE:
Tripling the gas cost of calldata reduces the maximum possible block size by a factor of three.

The purpose of this EIP is to introduce a method that allows an Ethereum node to communicate the range of blocks it has available.

SPECIFICATION:
- Advertise a new `eth` protocol capability (version) at `eth/70`. - The old `eth/69` protocol should still be kept alive side-by-side, until `eth/70` is

MOTIVATION:
In a first stage of [EIP-4444](./eip-4444.md), some nodes will still need to serve the historical data of the chain and others might be interested

RATIONALE:
Including the available block range in the `eth` handshake allows for immediate understanding of peer capabilities. This can lead to more efficient networking as

SPECIFICATION:
Revert the `initcode` size limit introduced in EIP-3860. Specifically: - Remove the 49152-byte cap on `initcode` size during contract creation. - Retain existing gas

MOTIVATION:
The EIP-3860 `initcode` size limit imposes an unnecessary constraint on deployment patterns, particularly for creation transactions creating large _logical_ contracts composed of multiple _physical

RATIONALE:
This proposal is driven by the need to restore flexibility in contract deployment patterns, such as factory contracts creating multiple sub-contracts in one transaction.

SUMMARY:
This EIP proposes an adjustment to calldata pricing by raising the floor cost from 10/40 to 15/60 gas per zero/non-zero calldata byte. This reduces

SPECIFICATION:
| Parameter | Value | | ---------------------------- | ----- | | `STANDARD_TOKEN_COST` | `4` | | `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN` | `15` | Let `tokens_in_calldata = zero_bytes_in_calldata

MOTIVATION:
While [EIP-7623](./eip-7623.md) successfully reduced the maximum possible block size by introducing a floor cost of 10/40 gas per byte for data-heavy transactions, continued increases

RATIONALE:
With [EIP-7623](./eip-7623.md)'s implementation, data-heavy transactions cost 10/40 gas per zero/non-zero byte, reducing the maximum possible EL payload size to approximately 1.07 MB (`45s_000_000/40`). This

SPECIFICATION:
Add a `IS_STATIC (0x4A)` opcode that pushes `1` if the current context is static (ie. the execution is in a `STATICCALL` or a descendant

MOTIVATION:
The main intended use case is to allow account abstraction (EIP 2938) to be extended so that accounts can allow static calls from the

This EIP proposes a new formula to update the base fee, derived from [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md). The existing base fee update formula, $$b[i+1]\triangleq b[i] \cdot \left(

SPECIFICATION:
$s[i]$ is replaced by $s_{\textit{avg}}[i]$, where: $$s_{\textit{avg}}[i] \triangleq \alpha\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-\alpha)^k\cdot s[i-k+1]$$ which simplifies to the recursive form $$s_{\textit{avg}}[i] = \alpha\cdot s[i] + (1-\alpha)\cdot s_{\textit{avg}}[i-1]$$

MOTIVATION:
To reduce bribe motivation when the demand for blockspace is high (see Incentive Considerations section) and to reduce oscillations, thus, having a more stable

SUMMARY:
This EIP proposes a new JSON-RPC method, `eth_sendRawTransactionSync`, which submits a signed raw transaction and waits synchronously for the transaction receipt or a configurable

SPECIFICATION:
### Method Name `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` ### Parameters | Position | Type | Description | Required | |----------|------------|-----------------------------------|----------| | 1 | `DATA` | The signed transaction

MOTIVATION:
Currently, Ethereum clients submit signed transactions asynchronously using `eth_sendRawTransaction`. Clients receive a transaction hash immediately but must poll repeatedly for the transaction receipt, which

RATIONALE:
### Why Not Extend Existing RPC? Modifying `eth_sendRawTransaction` to support this behavior would risk compatibility issues and ambiguity. A separate method makes the semantics

SPECIFICATION:
The cost of storing an account over time is called `rent`. The amount of `rent` due depends on the size of the account. The

MOTIVATION:
The Ethereum blockchain in its current form is not sustainable because it grows indefinitely. This is true of any blockchain, but Ethereum grows faster

Modify the encoding for receipts in the `Receipts (0x10)` message as follows: - (eth/69): `[request-id: P, [[receipt₁, receipt₂], ...]]` - (eth/70): `[request-id: P, lastBlockIncomplete:

MOTIVATION:
As Ethereum moves toward a higher block gas limit on mainnet, the worst-case total size of a block receipts list also becomes larger, and

RATIONALE:
Since [EIP-7825] caps the gas limit of a single transaction to ~16.7M gas, a single transaction receipt will always be limited in size. Specifically,

SUMMARY:
Five new EVM jump instructions are introduced (`RJUMP`, `RJUMPI`, `RJUMPV`, `RJUMPSUB`, and `RJUMPSUBV`) which encode destinations as signed immediate values. These can be useful

SPECIFICATION:
We introduce five new instructions, each taking either a two-byte relative offset or else a table of offsets as immediate arguments. 1) relative jump:

MOTIVATION:
A recurring discussion topic is that the EVM only has a mechanism for dynamic jumps. They provide a very flexible architecture with only 2

RATIONALE:
### Relative addressing We chose relative addressing in order to support code which is relocatable. This also means a code snippet can be injected.

MOTIVATION:
Roots of the beacon chain blocks are cryptographic accumulators that allow proofs of arbitrary consensus state. Exposing these roots inside the EVM allows for

Introduce a new opcode, `CLZ(x)`, which pops `x` from the stack and pushes the number of leading zero bits in `x` to the stack.

SPECIFICATION:
A new opcode is introduced: `CLZ` (`0x1e`). - Pops 1 value from the stack. - Pushes a value to the stack, according to the

MOTIVATION:
Count leading zeros (CLZ) is a native opcode in many processor architectures (even in RISC architectures like ARM). It is a basic building block

This proposal introduces a protocol-level cap on the maximum RLP-encoded execution block size to 10 megabytes (MiB), which includes a margin of 2 MiB

SPECIFICATION:
### Block Size Cap - Introduce constants: - `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` set to **10 MiB (10,485,760 bytes)** - `SAFETY_MARGIN` set to **2MiB (2,097,152 bytes)** - `MAX_RLP_BLOCK_SIZE`

MOTIVATION:
Currently, Ethereum does not enforce a strict upper limit on the encoded size of blocks. This lack of constraint can result in: 1. **Network

RATIONALE:
### Why 10 MiB? A cap of 10 MiB aligns with the gossip protocol constraint in Ethereum's consensus layer (CL). An additional 2MiB margin

SPECIFICATION:
Add a `BLOBBASEFEE` instruction with opcode `0x4a`, with gas cost `2`. | Op | Input | Output | Cost | |------|-------|--------|------| | 0x4a |

MOTIVATION:
The intended use case would be for contracts to get the value of the blob base-fee. This feature enables blob-data users to programmatically account

RATIONALE:
### Gas cost The value of the blob base-fee is needed to process data-blob transactions. That means its value is already available before running

SPECIFICATION:
The behaviour of `SELFDESTRUCT` is changed in the following way: 1. When `SELFDESTRUCT` is executed in a transaction that is not the same as

MOTIVATION:
The `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode requires large changes to the state of an account, in particular removing all code and storage. This will not be possible

RATIONALE:
Getting rid of the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode has been considered in the past, and there are currently no strong reasons to use it. This EIP

All Whisper messages sent as ÐΞVp2p Wire Protocol packets should be RLP-encoded arrays of data containing two objects: integer packet code followed by another

MOTIVATION:
It is necessary to specify the standard for Whisper messages in order to ensure forward compatibility of different Whisper clients.

RATIONALE:
Packet codes 0x00 and 0x01 are already used in all Whisper versions. Packet code 0x02 will be necessary for the future development of Whisper.

STATUS: Review
CREATED: 2024-12-06
REQUIRES: 

SUMMARY:
This EIP proposes to add a new opcode `SLOTNUM` (`0x4b`), that returns the corresponding slot number for the current block.

SPECIFICATION:
A new opcode `SLOTNUM` is introduced at `0x4b`. It shall return one stack element. ### Output One element `SlotNumber` is added to the stack;

MOTIVATION:
There are currently two ways to get the current slot number onchain: 1) Calculate from the block timestamp. This requires hardcoding the chain slot

RATIONALE:
### Gas Price The opcode is priced to match similar opcodes in the `W_base` set. ### Calculation in consensus layer The slot number could

Native bitwise shifting instructions are introduced, which are more efficient processing wise on the host and are cheaper to use by a contract.

SPECIFICATION:
The following instructions are introduced: ### `0x1b`: `SHL` (shift left) The `SHL` instruction (shift left) pops 2 values from the stack, first `arg1` and

MOTIVATION:
EVM is lacking bitwise shifting operators, but supports other logical and arithmetic operators. Shift operations can be implemented via arithmetic operators, but that has

RATIONALE:
Instruction operands were chosen to fit the more natural use case of shifting a value already on the stack. This means the operand order

SUMMARY:
Introduce the `PUSH0` (`0x5f`) instruction, which pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack.

SPECIFICATION:
The instruction `PUSH0` is introduced at `0x5f`. It has no immediate data, pops no items from the stack, and places a single item with

MOTIVATION:
Many instructions expect offsets as inputs, which in a number of cases are zero. A good example is the return data parameters of `CALLs`,

RATIONALE:
### Gas cost The `base` gas cost is used for instructions which place constant values onto the stack, such as `ADDRESS`, `ORIGIN`, and so

SPECIFICATION:
Definitions of terms are as below: * *Storage slot's original value*: This is the value of the storage if a reversion happens on the

MOTIVATION:
This EIP proposes a way for gas metering on SSTORE (as an alternative for EIP-1087 and EIP-1153), using information that is more universally available

RATIONALE:
This EIP mostly achieves what a transient storage tries to do (EIP-1087 and EIP-1153), but without the complexity of introducing the concept of "dirty

SPECIFICATION:
#### Remove Exponential Component of Difficulty Adjustment For the purposes of `calc_difficulty`, simply remove the exponential difficulty adjustment component, `epsilon`, i.e. the `int(2**((block.number //

MOTIVATION:
Due to the "difficulty bomb" (also known as the "ice age"), introduced in EIP [#2](./eip-2.md), an artificial exponential increase in difficulty until chain freeze,

RATIONALE:
This will permanently, without further changes, disable the "ice age." It will also reset the block reward to pre-Byzantium levels. Both of these changes

This EIP allows for tail call optimizations in EOF functions ([EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md)) by introducing a new instruction `JUMPF`, which jumps to a code section without

SPECIFICATION:
### Type section changes We define a non-returning section as one that cannot return control to its caller section. Type section `outputs` field contains

MOTIVATION:
It is common for functions to make a call at the end of the routine only to then return. `JUMPF` optimizes this behavior by

[EIP-2124](./eip-2124.md) proposed a way of identifying nodes on the p2p network based on their chain configuration via the forkid parameter. It allows nodes to

SPECIFICATION:
Each node maintains the following values: - **`FORK_HASH`**: IEEE CRC32 checksum (`[4]byte`) of the genesis hash and fork blocks numbers or timestamps that already

MOTIVATION:
While in proof-of-work forks were scheduled by block number, the proof-of-stake consensus layer schedules forks by slot number. The slot number is a time

RATIONALE:
Shanghai will be scheduled by timestamp thus the forkid calculations need to be updated to work with timestamps and blocks. Since all block number

SUMMARY:
This EIP assigns a reserve price `BLOB_BASE_COST * base_fee_per_gas` to blobs by introducing an `if`-clause in `calc_excess_blob_gas()`. Specifically, when the reserve price is higher

SPECIFICATION:
### Parameters | Constant | Value | - | - | | `BLOB_BASE_COST` | `2**13` | ### Functions An `if`-clause is added to `calc_excess_blob_gas()`

MOTIVATION:
Ethereum uses a dynamic pricing auction to set the blob base fee, lowering the fee if less gas is consumed than `target_blob_gas = GAS_PER_BLOB

This EIP suggests to add precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on a specific pairing-friendly elliptic curve. This can in turn be combined

SPECIFICATION:
If `block.number >= BYZANTIUM_FORK_BLKNUM`, add precompiled contracts for point addition (ADD) and scalar multiplication (MUL) on the elliptic curve "alt_bn128". Address of ADD: 0x6

MOTIVATION:
Current smart contract executions on Ethereum are fully transparent, which makes them unsuitable for several use-cases that involve private information like the location, identity

RATIONALE:
The specific curve `alt_bn128` was chosen because it is particularly well-suited for zkSNARKs, or, more specifically their verification building block of pairing functions. Furthermore,

SPECIFICATION:
### Execution Layer On the execution layer, an additional check is introduced for new payloads. After all of the transactions in the payload have

MOTIVATION:
In an effort to shield the Ethereum validator set from centralizing forces, the right to build blocks has been auctioned off to specialized entities

SUMMARY:
The Ethereum Wire Protocol defines request and response messages for exchanging data between clients. The `NewPooledTransactionHashes` message announces transactions available in the node. This

SPECIFICATION:
Modify the `NewPooledTransactionHashes (0x08)` message: * **(eth/67)**: `[hash_0: B_32, hash_1: B_32, ...]` * **(eth/68)**: `[types: B, [size_0: P, size_1: P, ...], [hash_0: B_32, hash_1:

MOTIVATION:
The `NewPooledTransactionHashes` message announces transaction hashes, allowing the peer to selectively fetch transactions it does not yet have. [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) introduces a new transaction type

RATIONALE:
This change will make the `eth` protocol future-proof for new transaction types that might not be relevant for all nodes. It gives the receiving

SPECIFICATION:
### Terminology and constants | Name | Description | Default | |-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------| | `WINDOW_SIZE_BLOCKS`| Number of recent blocks over which a discount may apply.

MOTIVATION:
Current warm and cold access pricing correctly models client state costs in the *worst case* but leaves a predictable efficiency gap in the *common

REQUIRES: 3508

SUMMARY:
This EIP introduces the following EVM instruction: `ENTRYPOINT`. This instruction is meant to provide access to the original recipient of the transaction, the `to`

SPECIFICATION:
### ENTRYPOINT (`0x4a`) The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction uses 0 stack arguments and pushes the original `to` member of the transaction onto the stack. The address

MOTIVATION:
It is undeniable that smart contracts are becoming more interconnected than ever. Up until this point, smart contracts have entirely relied on compliant interfaces

RATIONALE:
### AUTHCALL (`0xf7`) Interaction The [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md) introduced a new call instruction called `AUTHCALL` (`0xf7`) that will replace a transaction's `ORIGIN` (`0x32`) with the context

TITLE: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations
TYPE: Standards Track Core
STATUS: Final
CREATED: 2022-03-10
REQUIRES: 

SUMMARY:
Introduce a system-level "operation" to support validator withdrawals that are "pushed" from the beacon chain to the EVM. These operations create unconditional balance increases

SPECIFICATION:
| constants | value | units |--- |--- |--- | `FORK_TIMESTAMP` | 1681338455 | Beginning with the execution timestamp `FORK_TIMESTAMP`, execution clients **MUST** introduce

MOTIVATION:
This EIP provides a way for validator withdrawals made on the beacon chain to enter into the EVM. The architecture is "push"-based, rather than

TYPE: Standards Track Core
STATUS: Stagnant
CREATED: 2021-06-23
REQUIRES: 3, 5, 4, 0, ,,  , 3, 6, 7, 0

SUMMARY:
Introduce a section in the EOF format ([EIP-3540](./eip-3540.md)) for storing the list of `JUMPDEST`s, validate the correctness of this list at the time of

SPECIFICATION:
This feature is introduced on the very same block [EIP-3540](./eip-3540.md) is enabled, therefore every EOF1-compatible bytecode MUST have a JUMPDEST-table if it uses jumps.

MOTIVATION:
Currently existing contracts require no validation of correctness, but every time they are executed, a list must be built containing all the valid jump-destinations.

RATIONALE:
### Jumpdests section is bounded The length of the `jumpdests` section is bounded by the EOF maximum section size value 0xffff. Moreover, for deployed

SUMMARY:
Updates the [EIP-3155](./eip-3155.md) JSON tracing specification to support EOF features.

SPECIFICATION:
To promote clarity and provide a cohesive specification, the entire tracing specification will be presented with alterations in-line rather than as a set of

MOTIVATION:
EIP-3155 defined a tracing standard for Legacy EVM operations. However, the EVM Object Format ([EIP-7692](./eip-7692.md)) adds a number of features that need to be

RATIONALE:
This EIP is an extension of the EIP-3155 tracing features that has been in use for years. Rather than dramatically re-boot the feature, the

TITLE: Set upper bounds for MODEXP
TYPE: Standards Track Core
STATUS: Last Call
CREATED: 2024-11-11
REQUIRES: 198

SUMMARY:
Introduce an upper bound on the inputs of the MODEXP precompile. This can reduce the number of potential bugs, because the testing surface is

SPECIFICATION:
Recap from [EIP-198](./eip-198.md): > At address `0x00……05`, add a precompile that expects input in the following format: > > `<length_of_BASE> <length_of_EXPONENT> <length_of_MODULUS> <BASE> <EXPONENT>

MOTIVATION:
The MODEXP precompile has been a source of numerous consensus bugs. Many of them were due to specifically crafted cases using impractical input lengths.

RATIONALE:
### Limit This upper bound allows the existing use cases of MODEXP: 1. RSA verification with up to 8192 bit keys. Commonly used ones
